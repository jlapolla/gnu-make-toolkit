ifndef require # Include guard
# Function "require"
#
# Description:
#
# Use "require" instead of Make's built-in "include" directive to
# include Makefiles designed to work with modular.mk.
#
# Usage:
#
# exports := $(call require,<path_to_makefile>)

require = $(sort \
  $(eval exports :=) \
  $(eval _d_stack := $(_d_stack) $(dir $(1))) \
  $(eval d := $(lastword $(_d_stack))) \
  $(eval include $(1)) \
  $(exports) \
  $(eval _d_stack := $(wordlist 2,$(words $(_d_stack)),x $(_d_stack))) \
  $(eval d := $(lastword $(_d_stack))) \
  $(eval exports :=) \
)
# Explanation:
# Line 1  : Apply "sort" function to exports list returned on Line 6
# Line 2  : Reset exports list to empty string
# Line 3  : Push new directory onto _d_stack
# Line 4  : Set d to new directory
# Line 5  : Include the Makefile at "path_to_makefile"
# Line 6  : Return exports list set by the included "path_to_makefile"
# Line 7  : Pop directory from _d_stack
# Line 8  : Reset d to old directory
# Line 9  : Reset exports list to empty string
# Line 10 : Terminate "sort" function arguments list
